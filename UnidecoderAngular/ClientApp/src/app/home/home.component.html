<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
  Every character (letter, digit, punctuation, emoji,...) of any language has its own codepoint and name in the Unicode character set.
  At least, that is what the Unicode Consortium is aiming for.<br/>
  For more info, see the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/faq/" target="_blank">Unicode FAQ</a>.

<div>
  Unicode only describes the name and meaning of a character, <strong>not</strong> how it should be shown on screen or in print.
  That is the task of the <i>font</i> and leads to some issues:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Specific characters may look the same on one computer (or tablet, or phone) but different on another, because of differences in the installed font.
      <ul>
        <li>An example: "Î¿" and "o" are different letters</li>
        <li>Sometimes <a [routerLink]="['text', '%F0%9F%87%B3%F0%9F%87%B1']">&#127475;&#127473;</a> is shown as "NL" (for instance on Windows), sometimes as a flag (for instance on Android)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Most fonts (probably even <em>all</em>) do not support the full unicode character set
      &ndash; which after all also includes ancient characters like <a [routerLink]="['block', 'Cuneiform']">Cuneiform</a> and others that are "not in everyday use", such as <a [routerLink]="['block', 'Domino Tiles']">Domino Tiles</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div>
  This app knows details about {{ characterCount }} characters {{ versionTag }}.
</div>
<div class="hidden">
  Use the other tabs to find out more:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Show characters</strong>: shows the characters in a text that you maybe copied from somewhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Find characters</strong>: tries to find characters by name or codepoint.</li>
    <li><strong>Find by block</strong>: shows all characters that belong to a selected block.</li>
    <li><strong>Find by category</strong>: shows all characters that belong to a selected category.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>Characters are shown like this:</div>
<div style="width:220px">
<app-char-info [character]="sampleChar"></app-char-info>
</div>
<div>
  Meaning:
  <ul>
    <li>(big, on a dark background) The character (in the current font). Click to copy.</li>
    <li>(bold) The name of the character (search for this in tab 3)</li>
    <li>The block name (see tab 4). The link leads you there.</li>
    <li>(cursive) The category of the character.</li>
    <li>The codepoint of the character: both hexadecimal and decimal. The links show this character and surrounding ones.</li>
  </ul>
